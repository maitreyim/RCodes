coursera_programming-r
======================

Code I wrote for the Fall 2012 Coursera Computing for Data Analysis (R) class. Below, I copied the syllabus from the course website.


Syllabus
=========
In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment, discuss generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, creating informative data graphics, accessing R packages, creating R packages with documentation, writing R functions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis and optimization will provide working examples.

Objectives
===========
After taking this course you should be able to

Read formatted data into R
Subset, remove missing values from, and clean tabular data
Write custom functions in R to implement new functionality and making use of control structures such as loops and conditonals
Use the R code debugger to identify problems in R functions
Make a scatterplot/boxplot/histogram/image plot and modify a plot with custom annotations
Define a new data class in R and write methods for that class


Grading
========
Your grade in this course will consist of performance on four weekly quizzes and two programming assignments. The breakdown of the weighting for these elements is

Week 1 Quiz: 10 points
Week 2 Quiz: 10 points
Week 3 Quiz: 10 points
Week 4 Quiz: 10 points
Programming assignment 1: 30 points
Programming assignment 2: 30 points
There is a maximum of 100 points to obtain in this course through the four quizzes and the two programming assignments.

Performance in this course will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. The final grade for the course will be based on the total number of points earned across the four quizzes and two programming assignments. In order to receive a passing grade, you must have a earned a total number of points of 70 or more.
